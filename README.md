In this repository you'll find all the code used in my blog post series on Machine Learning. 

Just download the files you need or clone the entire repository. The code works fine on Python version 3.6.3 with versions of dependencies:

Pandas : v0.20.3,
Matplotlib : v2.1.0,
Numpy : v1.13.3

Steps for installating Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
